# enhancement-proposals

Enhancement proposals for open-source Iterative projects.

This repository is for structured discussions about large modifications or additions to Iterative projects.

## Description

An enhancement proposal is a design document providing information to the community, or describing a new feature. The proposal should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for adopting it.

We intend proposals to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major changes, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Iterative projects. Smaller changes can be discussed and implemented directly on the main repositories.

## Submitting a proposal

To create a new proposal, please:

1. Copy TEMPLATE.md into the proposals folder.
2. Rename the file to something descriptive of the proposal.
3. Draft the proposal, using the template structure.
4. Open a pull request on this repository.

It is highly recommended that each proposal contains a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the proposal, the more successful it tends to be. If in doubt, split your proposal into several well-scoped ones.
